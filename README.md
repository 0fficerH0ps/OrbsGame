Hello!
Thank you for checking out my game!

To play:
1. Download the .zip file
2. Unzip folder
3. Double click file called Orbs.exe
Note: The game does not have a way to close out currently so you will need to do that manualy. On Windows you can use Task Manager to do so.
The game currently has controller support.
